# Shared Whiteboard

A mixed reality tool that will bring distributed development to another level!
You want to discuss something with your colleague in front of the whiteboard, but you can't because you are on distant locations?
No problem.
Using this tool, you can now connect and share a whiteboard while you are away from each other.
Checkout the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaNWddFmEZ0&feature=youtu.be)!

## Usage

Inside [GENERATEDAPP] folder, there is a package which you can deploy to your HoloLens.

After application starts, you will be asked to chose type of the whiteboard you want to work with.
You can either choose White or Transparent by clicking on one of two buttons or pronouncing one of these words.
You can change this at any later moment as well.  
When you have chosen whiteboard type, you will see the virtual whiteboard in front of you. 
Tap it to start placing it and then tap again when you want to fix it.
When you are finished, just say "Done" and the virtual whiteboard will be placed.
If you later want to change position of your virtual whiteboard, you can say "Adjust" and repeat the placing process.  
Finally, you need to connect with other user.
In the dialog that opens, select Start a session to start a new session or enter session pin and click OK to connect to existing session.
This is the final step.  
Now, you can start sharing.
Whenever you are in good position to send your content (whiteboard frame is green), you can say "Send" and your content will be sent to other user.
